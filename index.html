                Hello! My name is Esteban Garces and I'm an aspiring full stack developer. Programming has always come across to me as this mystical and foreign study, so I'm excited to delve into this field one step at a time. Here, you can check out my portfolio to follow in real time how I'm progressing and learning. I hope that you like what you see, and if you have any suggestions or would like contact me you're more than welcome to reach out. I'd love to hear from you! 
            </p>
            <p class="">
                I was born and raised here in Austin, Texas and graduated from Texas A&M with a bachelor's in Psychology and Spanish. My hobbies (usually) include playing the new RPG on my PS4, watching basketball or football, or going to concerts. I say that, but for the near future I'm not going to have time for any of that in the near future! I love traveling and have spent large amounts of time in Costa Rica and Mexico, and I always welcome a good food recommendation.
